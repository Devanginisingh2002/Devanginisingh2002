    - 🟢  Social Distancing Device.
      - [Demonstrating Video] (https://youtu.be/t4wBPgHjj4k) and [Documentation] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1grW_BKuuz829A5os3bQ42C5gyVEAMfGh?usp=sharing).
      -  A hardware-based project, solves the issue of Social Distancing, a mechanism that allows users to maintain physical  distance.
      - Software, requirement Using Arduino coding (basics of C++), and Tableau for the data visualisation.
      - Hardware requirement, I use two Arduinos as one is connected to an ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, and vibration motor.  Another Arduino is attached to the LCD to avoid gathering people by displaying "Safe distance" and "Wear masks" on the LCD.  Patient Care Monitoring System.
