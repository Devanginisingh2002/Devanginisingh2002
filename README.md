üî¥ Some major projects
 - üü¢ ‚Ä®Social Distancing Device
     - Demonstration: [video](https://youtu.be/t4wBPgHjj4k)
     - Documentation: [Doc](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1grW_BKuuz829A5os3bQ42C5gyVEAMfGh?usp=sharing)
     - ‚Ä®A hardware-based project, solves the issue of Social Distancing, a mechanism that allows users to maintain physical ‚Ä®distance.
     - Software, requirement Using Arduino coding (basics of C++), and Tableau for the data visualisation.
     - Hardware requirement, I use two Arduinos as one is connected to an ultrasonic sensor, buzzer, and vibration motor. ‚Ä®Another
       Arduino is attached to the LCD to avoid gathering people by displaying "Safe distance" and "Wear masks" on the LCD.
